An ugly number is a positive integer whose prime factors are limited to 2, 3, and 5.

Given an integer n, return true if n is an ugly number.

 

Example 1:

Input: n = 6
Output: true
Explanation: 6 = 2 Ã— 3
Example 2:

Input: n = 1
Output: true
Explanation: 1 has no prime factors, therefore all of its prime factors are limited to 2, 3, and 5.
Example 3:

Input: n = 14
Output: false
Explanation: 14 is not ugly since it includes the prime factor 7.
 

Constraints:

-231 <= n <= 231 - 1




class Solution:
    def isUgly(self, n: int) -> bool:

        if n < 1: return False
        if n == 1: return True

        good = set([2, 3, 5])

        def ugly(a, base):
            if a in good:
                return True
            if a % base != 0:
                return False
            new_a = a // base
            return ugly(new_a, 2) or ugly(new_a, 3) or ugly(new_a, 5)

        return ugly(n, 2) or ugly(n, 3) or ugly(n, 5)
